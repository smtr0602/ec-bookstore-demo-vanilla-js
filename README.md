## What is this?

This is a responsive demo EC bookstore web application created with vanilla JS without any framework as one the school projects.

The criteria were creating an EC website top page using vanilla JS, so I decided to create one for kutaka team, which I work with.

This is a demo app and it does not have any backend functionalities other than the JSON book data.

### Features

- Swipeable slides to browse books
- Book information fades in when stop swiping
- "Look inside" button to peek inside (just the ui for this project and it doest not actually show inside)
- Add items with a few animations

## Built with

- HTML, CSS (SCSS), JavaScript
- Swiper.js
- JSON Blob (for backend data)
